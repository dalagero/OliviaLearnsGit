GitHub needs ssh key for pushing to git... know that.

1) To clone a repository (public):
git clone [ssh thing from the gitHub repoisitory page]

2) If you need to add a file:
git add [file name]

3) Then commit the file (or directory or whatever):
git commit [file name]

Note: "git commit" will commit everything within the repository

4) To push it to the gitHub:
git push




To pull:
git pull [repository]

Then push again.




Making a new branch and switching to the new branch:
git checkout -b [branch name]

Then commit and push as normal





To switch branches on the terminal:
git checkout [branch name]


To check if its up to date:
git fetch
*** if not up to date, run git pull now!!!***

To merge branches (moves the files of the branch to main, but keeps the branch as well), from main branch:
git merge [branch name]
